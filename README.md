# Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2, and then finding the remaining unmarked numbers, which are the primes.

This repository contains implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in various programming languages.
